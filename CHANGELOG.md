# Changelog

## Unreleased
### Added
- `Terminal.rawPrint` which allows you to print ANSI codes manually. [(#91)](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant/issues/91)

### Changed
- Fix typo in enum name: renamed `Borders.TOM_BOTTOM` to `Borders.TOP_BOTTOM`. [(#100)](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant/issues/100)

## 2.0.0-beta13
### Added
- Add `Animation.stop()` to stop an animation without clearing it. [(#95)](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant/issues/95)
- Animations now support resuming after a call to `stop` or `clear`. [(#94)](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant/issues/94)
- `TextStyles.reset`, `TextStyles.resetForeground`, and `TextStyles.resetBackground` to clear existing styles.

### Fixed
- Fix `TerminalInfo.interactive` not including `outputInteractive`
- Fix prompts on JS targets that were broken by KT-55817 

### Changed
- **Source-incompatible change:** All boolean fields on `TextStyle` are now nullable. A null field indicates no change to the previous value when adding or nesting styles.
- `verticalLayout{}` now defaults `TextAlign.NONE`, meaning it won't add any trailing whitespace to lines. You can return to the old behavior with `align = TextAlign.LEFT`.
- When nesting styles, the outer style will now override inner styles at the start of a string. (e.g. `red(blue("x")) == red("x")`) 
- Definition List terms and entries can now be empty

## 2.0.0-beta12
### Fixed
- Switch back to calling `stty` for `detectTerminalSize` on macOS. [(#86)](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant/issues/86)
- `OverflowWrap` is now properly ignored when using a non-wrapping `Whitespace` value. 

## 2.0.0-beta11
### Added
- Tables and other layouts can now be completely empty [(#82)](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant/issues/82)

### Changed

### Removed

## 2.0.0-beta10
### Changed
- JVM: terminal detection now uses JNA to call kernel functions directly. 
- Interactive state of stdin and stdout are now detected separately. 
- Terminal size detection is now fast since it does not need a subprocess.

### Fixed
- Detect terminal correctly when running in the IntelliJ terminal tab, but not through a run action. [(#76)](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant/issues/76)

### Deprecated 
- `timeoutMs` parameter to `TerminalDetection.updateTerminalSize`. This function is now fast on all platforms. 

## 2.0.0-beta9

- `updateTerminalSize` would sometimes fail to find the `stty` command [(#66)](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant/issues/66)

## 2.0.0-beta7
### Added
- Functionality for reading user input: `Terminal.readLineOrNull`, `Terminal.prompt` and various `Prompt` classes
- `TerminalRecorder` that saves output to memory rather than printing it.
- `TerminalRecorder.outputAsHtml()` that can render recorded output as an html file.
- 
### Changed
- When building tables, `borders` has been renamed `cellBorders`, and `outerBorder: Boolean` has been replaced with `tableBorders: Borders?`, which allows more control over the table's outside borders. [(#58)](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant/issues/58)
- Update Kotlin to 1.7.0

### Fixed
- Avoid clobbering output when using `Terminal.forStdErr` while an animation is running. [(#54)](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant/issues/54)
