# Changelog

## 2.3.0
### Added
- Vararg constructors for `UnorderedList` and `OrderedList`
- `UnorderedList` and `OrderedList` now support being empty 
- Added optional terminal frame to `TerminalRecorder.outputAsHtml`
- New implementation of progress bars with a number of improvements:
  - Any widget can be added to a progress layout, not just the built-in cell types
  - TODO New cell: timeElapsed
  - Added `compact` style to `timeRemaining` cells.
  - Added `marquee` cell that can scroll text that is larger than a fixed width. 
- Added `Viewport` widget that can crop or pad another widget to a fixed size, and scroll it within that size.
- Added `precision` parameter to `completed` progress cell that controls the number of decimal places shown.
- Animation now handle terminal resizing, although on some terminals, partially drawn frames may be visible. Due to a bug in JNI, the terminal size isn't automatically updated on JVM on macOS.

### Changed
- When setting conflicting styles on a `Table` or its cells, the innermost style now takes precedence (i.e. if you set different styles on the whole table and a cell, the style applied to the cell will be used). 
- Animations now never add a trailing newline while they're running. They always add one once the animation is stopped. The `trailNewline` parameter is deprecated. This allows full screen animations without a blank line at the bottom. 

### Fixed
- Updated bundled proguard rules [(#130)](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant/issues/130)

## 2.2.0
### Added
- Added `ColumnWidth.Custom` that allows more control over column width behavior in tables. [(#109)](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant/issues/109)
- Added `showPulse` parameter to `ProgressLayout.progressBar`, allowing you to disable the pulse animation for a bar.
- Added support for detecting terminal capabilities on mintty. Thanks to @sschuberth for the contribution. [(#127)](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant/issues/127)

### Changed
- Update Kotlin to 1.9
- Use the native C API when building a native image on GraalVM, which reduces binary size and removes the need to reflection. Thanks to @hubvd for the contribution [(#119)](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant/issues/119)

### Fixed
- Fixed exception thrown in environments that are missing required shared native libraries.
- Fixed animations clearing too much space when the animation changes size while running. [(#110)](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant/issues/110)
- Improved terminal capability detection for Xterm terminals. [(#113)](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant/issues/113)
- Update Markdown parser dependency to fix crashes on native release executables

## 2.1.0
### Added
- Added `ConfirmationPrompt` that asks the user to enter the same value twice, which is commonly used for password inputs.

## 2.0.1
### Added
- Include metadata in JVM jars to support GraalVM native-image.

### Fixed
- Fix animations printing an extra frame after `stop` is called when running in the IntelliJ console. [(#105)](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant/issues/105)

## 2.0.0
### Deprecated
- Deprecated `TerminalColors` is favor of `TextColors` and `Terminal.theme`

## 2.0.0-beta14
### Added
- `Terminal.rawPrint` which allows you to print ANSI codes manually. [(#91)](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant/issues/91)
- Option to disable trailing line breaks on animations.
- `Terminal.print`, `println`, and `rawPrint` now accept a `stderr` parameter that will print to stderr (if available). 

### Changed
- Fix typo in enum name: renamed `Borders.TOM_BOTTOM` to `Borders.TOP_BOTTOM`. [(#100)](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant/issues/100)
- The terminal cursor will now be hidden when `progressAnimation` is running.

### Removed
- Removed `TerminalRecorder.currentContent`. Use `stdout()`, `stderr()` or `output()` instead.
- Removed `Terminal.forStdErr()` and `TerminalInterface.forStdErr()`. Use `Terminal.println(stderr=true)` instead.

## 2.0.0-beta13
### Added
- Add `Animation.stop()` to stop an animation without clearing it. [(#95)](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant/issues/95)
- Animations now support resuming after a call to `stop` or `clear`. [(#94)](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant/issues/94)
- `TextStyles.reset`, `TextStyles.resetForeground`, and `TextStyles.resetBackground` to clear existing styles.

### Fixed
- Fix `TerminalInfo.interactive` not including `outputInteractive`
- Fix prompts on JS targets that were broken by KT-55817 

### Changed
- **Source-incompatible change:** All boolean fields on `TextStyle` are now nullable. A null field indicates no change to the previous value when adding or nesting styles.
- `verticalLayout{}` now defaults `TextAlign.NONE`, meaning it won't add any trailing whitespace to lines. You can return to the old behavior with `align = TextAlign.LEFT`.
- When nesting styles, the outer style will now override inner styles at the start of a string. (e.g. `red(blue("x")) == red("x")`) 
- Definition List terms and entries can now be empty

## 2.0.0-beta12
### Fixed
- Switch back to calling `stty` for `detectTerminalSize` on macOS. [(#86)](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant/issues/86)

## 2.0.0-beta10
### Changed
- JVM: terminal detection now uses JNA to call kernel functions directly. 
- Interactive state of stdin and stdout are now detected separately. 
- Terminal size detection is now fast since it does not need a subprocess.

### Fixed
- Detect terminal correctly when running in the IntelliJ terminal tab, but not through a run action. [(#76)](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant/issues/76)

### Deprecated 
- `timeoutMs` parameter to `TerminalDetection.updateTerminalSize`. This function is now fast on all platforms. 

## 2.0.0-beta9

- `updateTerminalSize` would sometimes fail to find the `stty` command [(#66)](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant/issues/66)

## 2.0.0-beta7
### Added
- Functionality for reading user input: `Terminal.readLineOrNull`, `Terminal.prompt` and various `Prompt` classes
- `TerminalRecorder` that saves output to memory rather than printing it.
- `TerminalRecorder.outputAsHtml()` that can render recorded output as an html file.
- 
### Changed
- When building tables, `borders` has been renamed `cellBorders`, and `outerBorder: Boolean` has been replaced with `tableBorders: Borders?`, which allows more control over the table's outside borders. [(#58)](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant/issues/58)
- Update Kotlin to 1.7.0

### Fixed
- Avoid clobbering output when using `Terminal.forStdErr` while an animation is running. [(#54)](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant/issues/54)
